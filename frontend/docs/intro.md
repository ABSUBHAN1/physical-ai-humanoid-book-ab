# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Agents

## Welcome to the Future of AI Education

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Agents**. This interactive textbook is designed to take you on a journey from fundamental AI concepts to the cutting-edge field of humanoid robotics.

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital AI to embodied intelligence that interacts with the physical world. Unlike conventional AI systems that process abstract data, Physical AI systems must understand and navigate the complexities of the real world, including physics, dynamics, and real-time constraints.

### Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots represent the pinnacle of embodied intelligence. They must integrate perception, cognition, and action in ways that mirror human capabilities. Building humanoid robots requires understanding of:

- **Perception**: How to sense and interpret the physical world
- **Cognition**: How to reason about physical interactions
- **Action**: How to execute complex motor behaviors
- **Learning**: How to adapt and improve through experience

### Course Structure

This textbook is organized into 8 modules, each building upon the previous to develop a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics:

1. **Introduction to Physical AI**: Foundational concepts and principles
2. **ROS Fundamentals**: Robot Operating System for robotics development
