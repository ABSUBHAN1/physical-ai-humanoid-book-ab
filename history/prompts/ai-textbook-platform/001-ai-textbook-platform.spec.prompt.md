## Prompt

Create an AI-native university-level textbook project titled \"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Agents\". The book will be built using Docusaurus and published on GitHub Pages. It will teach Physical AI, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action systems, and humanoid robotics through modular chapters, hands-on labs, Python/ROS code, and a capstone autonomous humanoid project. The book must be RAG-optimized, support personalization, Urdu translation, and integrate an embedded chatbot for question answering.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive feature specification for the AI textbook platform. The specification includes:

1. User scenarios for students, educators, and multilingual learners
2. Functional requirements covering content delivery, hands-on labs, chatbot integration, personalization, and translation
3. Success criteria with measurable outcomes
4. A quality checklist to validate the specification

The specification focuses on user value and business needs while avoiding implementation details. All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved, and the success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete feature specification for AI textbook platform
- 🧪 Tests: 
- 📁 Files: specs/01-ai-textbook-platform/spec.md, specs/01-ai-textbook-platform/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create technical plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully created with all required sections and validated against quality criteria
