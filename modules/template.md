# Chapter Template

This is a template for creating new chapters in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. Each chapter should follow this 10-section format to ensure consistency and comprehensive coverage of topics.

## Chapter Overview
[Provide a brief overview of what the chapter covers and why it's important in the context of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. This section should give readers a clear understanding of what they'll learn and how it fits into the broader curriculum.]

## Why This Matters in Physical AI
[Explain the significance of this topic specifically in the field of Physical AI. How does it relate to embodied intelligence? Why is this concept crucial for building intelligent physical systems?]

## Core Concepts
[Define and explain the key concepts covered in this chapter. Use clear, accessible language while maintaining technical accuracy. Include diagrams, examples, or analogies where helpful.]

## System Architecture or Mental Model
[Describe how the system or concept works conceptually. Provide a mental model that students can use to understand and remember the material. Include architectural diagrams if applicable.]

## Hands-On Lab/Simulation
[Provide a practical exercise for students to apply what they've learned. Include:
- Clear objectives
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected outcomes
- Troubleshooting tips
- Connection to simulation environments like Gazebo, Unity, or NVIDIA Isaac where applicable]

## Code Examples
[Include relevant code snippets with explanations. For robotics content, this often means Python/ROS 2 examples. Make sure to:
- Explain each code segment
- Highlight important parts
- Show expected outputs
- Provide links to complete examples in the modules/*/examples/ directories]

## Common Mistakes & Debugging
[Identify common errors students might encounter and how to resolve them. This section is crucial for self-directed learning and builds resilience in problem-solving.]

## Industry & Research Context
[Connect the chapter content to real-world applications and current research. Include:
- Examples of how this is used in industry
- Recent research papers or findings
- Future directions and open problems]

## Review Questions
[Include 3-5 questions to test understanding:
- At least one conceptual question
- At least one application question
- At least one critical thinking question]

## Glossary
[Define key terms introduced in this chapter. Each definition should be clear and concise, suitable for quick reference.]
